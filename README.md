Project integrating Zivid M60 2+ camera with a robot arm with a task of pick and place operation, adjusted for different position and orientation of the object. 
Technologies I plan on using: Zivid SDK, Open3D, PCL, Python, Tensorflow/PyTorch, Staubli Robotics Suite, Miniconda for virtual env,and potentially ROS2.
At the early stages of the project i will be using Python3 for faster and easier development but when i achieve certain features, i will try to do it also in C++.
Reason being that C++ is used widely in robotics for critical solutions, where performance and security is important.
